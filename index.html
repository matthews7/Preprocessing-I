      <p>There are many skills that I possess but the most important are problem solving and team work.</p>
      
      <p>I like to work with people and being to work together to accomplish a task that can be done. I think it comes down to being able to take a situation and understand the problem simply. Then create a plan by seperating the larger problem in to smaller ones. These then can be done by one person or distributed and conquered by a team. These small problems lead to create a solution to the larger problem.</p>
